## 🎯 Feature Modes

### **Auto Mode - Portfolio Gap Analysis**
- Analyzes your existing cards across 6 categories
- Finds categories where you have <1% improvement potential
- Recommends cards that fill the biggest gaps
- Shows current rate vs market-leading rate

**Example Output:**
```
Gap Found: Dining
Your rate: 1.5% → Market rate: 4.0% (+2.5% improvement)

Recommended: Chase Sapphire Preferred
- 2x on dining everywhere
- No annual fee
- +2.5% improvement over your current card
```

### **Category Mode - Targeted Search**
- Pick specific category (Dining, Grocery, Gas, Travel, Entertainment, Online)
- Shows top 5 cards for that category
- Filters out cards you already own
- Compares to your current best card in that category

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Real-Time Market Analysis**
- No caching needed - queries are ~10-50ms
- Always accurate, reflects current database
- Simple MAX() queries per category

### **Smart Algorithms**
- **Improvement Threshold**: 1%+ improvement to recommend
- **Priority Scoring**: High (3%+), Medium (1.5%+), Low priority
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Never suggests cards you already own
- **Reasonable Caps**: Market rates capped at 10% to avoid outliers

### **Database Queries**
```sql
-- Market rate lookup (blazing fast with index)
SELECT MAX(multiplier) FROM card_rewards WHERE category ILIKE '%Dining%';

-- Top cards for category
SELECT c.*, r.multiplier FROM cards c
INNER JOIN card_rewards r ON c.id = r.card_id
WHERE r.category ILIKE '%Dining%'
ORDER BY r.multiplier DESC, c.annual_fee ASC;
```

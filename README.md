## High-Level App Flow

1. **User signs up / logs in**
2. **User selects the credit cards they own**
3. **User inputs a description of a purchase**  
   e.g. "Iâ€™m booking a hotel in New York"
4. **System maps the input to a reward category**  
   e.g. "travel"
5. **System finds the user's card(s) with the best reward for that category**
6. **Returns recommendation with reasoning and caveats (if any)**
7. Show visual breakdown of their card coverage by category
8. Suggest new cards that fill category gaps

## Backend Data Flow

### 1. User Input
- Text: `"buy groceries at Trader Joe's"`

### 2. Category Mapping
- Preprocessed using:
  - Keyword rules (MVP)
  - or Semantic Embedding similarity
  - or LLM prompt classification
- Result: `"grocery"`

### 3. Userâ€™s Card List
- Pulled from user profile
- e.g. `["amex_blue_cash", "citi_custom_cash", "chase_freedom_flex"]`

### 4. Reward Lookup
- For each card:
  - Find matching reward rules for `"grocery"`
  - Evaluate:
    - reward rate (numeric)
    - units (`percent`, `points`)
    - cap? (`$500/month`, etc)
    - special conditions (e.g. portal only)

### 5. Scoring Logic
- Rank cards by:
  - Effective rate
  - Simplicity (e.g. no portal requirement)
  - Remaining cap (if tracked)
- Result: list of best cards, sorted

### 6. Response
- JSON response to frontend:
```json
{
  "category": "grocery",
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "cardName": "Amex Blue Cash Preferred",
      "rate": 6,
      "unit": "percent",
      "notes": "Valid at U.S. supermarkets, up to $6,000/year"
    },
    {
      "cardName": "Citi Custom Cash",
      "rate": 5,
      "unit": "percent",
      "notes": "Only your top monthly category (up to $500/month)"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Flow

### 1. Login Screen
- Auth system (Supabase/Auth0/etc)

### 2. Card Selection UI
- List of supported cards
- Toggle/select cards user owns

### 3. Purchase Input Form
- Freeform text input
- On submit â†’ calls backend /recommend endpoint

### 4. Recommendation Display
- Shows:
    - Top recommended card
    - Reward rate
    - Conditions or caps
    - Secondary options
- Optional toggle for full breakdown

### 5. Visual Coverage
- Grid style interactive heat map
    - What categories are covered?
    - What rate is covered?
    - What categories are missing?
        - users can hover and click into to view the card info

#### Design
The heatmap is structured as a **grid**:

- **Rows**: Spending categories (e.g. Dining, Travel, Grocery, Gas, etc.)
- **Columns**: User-selected credit cards
- **Cells**: Reward rates (e.g. 1x, 3x, 5%) for each card-category pair
  - Color intensity scales with reward rate
  - Cells are interactive:
    - **Hover** â†’ Tooltip with detailed reward info and restrictions
    - **Click** â†’ Modal with full explanation or add new card

#### Visual Example

| Category â†“ \ Card â†’ | Amex Gold | Freedom Flex | Citi Custom Cash |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Dining              | ðŸŸ¥ 4x      | ðŸŸ¨ 3x         | â¬œ 1x             |
| Grocery             | ðŸŸ§ 4x      | â¬œ 1x         | ðŸŸ¥ 5x (cap: $500/mo) |
| Travel              | ðŸŸ¨ 3x      | ðŸŸ¥ 5x (Q3 only) | â¬œ 1x           |
| Gas                 | â¬œ 1x      | ðŸŸ¥ 5x (Q2 only) | ðŸŸ¥ 5x           |

- ðŸŸ¥ = High reward (5x+)
- ðŸŸ§ = Medium (3â€“4x)
- ðŸŸ¨ = Low (2â€“3x)
- â¬œ = Default / fallback (1x or less)

#### Implementation Notes
- Built using a responsive, interactive grid with dynamic color scaling
- Powered by user's selected credit card data and internal reward category mappings
- Optionally integrates with the recommendation engine to highlight best card per category

#### Extras
- Ability to click a category and see recommended new cards to fill coverage gaps
- Simulated reward earnings based on user's spend profile
- Export/share visual to compare card setups

### 6. Suggested Cards
- Based on missing categories + estimated spend
